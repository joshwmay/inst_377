Files for assignments in Dynamic Web Applications

This repository was created for the first assignment in INST 377 (Fall '19).

Viewing the page, a user will find a brief biography related to an aspiring
pizza loving astronaut. 

There is use of flexbox throughout, but the page does not shift as dynamically
as one would like; and is best viewed zoomed out enough to fit all content. 

There are some subtly embedded links for things like time/unit conversions, and 
one link to bring users to this repository.

It was a fun project to work on, and hopefully it is fun to look at.

If I were to do anything different, I would add some JS and a clickbutton
to add gravity that stops the pizza from floating, and sends it to the bottom.
